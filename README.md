# Movie-Recommendation

This repository focuses on developing a movie recommendation algorithm based on scores, aiming to suggest titles to users based on their previous ratings and liking's. The goal of this system is to identify which movies or series a user is likely to enjoy, assigning a score to each title based on their behavior and preferences.

By comparing the performance of these algorithms in the context of personalized recommendations, we can find the best model to increase user satisfaction on streaming platforms. The findings of this study could contribute to optimizing content delivery and production, as well as significantly improving the user experience in modern entertainment environments. Therefore, the development of an efficient recommendation engine is essential to elevate the level of user engagement.

Models such as KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) models, Matrix Factorization algorithms (SVD, SVDpp, NMF), the Slope One algorithm and Co-Clustering, are used to predict the scores of movies and series. The data used in this study is the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/) dataset, which contains information about user ratings and movie titles.
